            <p class="my-info">Hello, and welcome to my Portfolio Sit. This site was created as a project for my HTML/CSS Module with Kingsland University. A little about me, I am 40 years old with a family of 5. I have 3 kids ages 3, 9 and 16! I married my Best Friend and have been very blessed for the past 10+ years.<br> My job history started in the Mechanical Industry working on Heavy Equipment to Heavy Trucks and Trailers. I grew into welding from highschool and stuck a career for 8 years in the oil field building Equipment and high pressure vessels. When the world was haulted with the Covid Pandemic in 2020 I was layed off from work with no signs of return.   </p>
